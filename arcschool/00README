ArcSchool.{zip,tgz}

Logo, Letterhead, fax and memo templates.

The zip file has been tailored to MsLoss users, and the tarball to unix
users.

I have reverted to my previous practice of putting `Arc' in front of all
packages that I maintain. Like Matlab, LaTeX ultimitely has a flat
namespace, and several name conflicts have ocurred. Theoretically, I should
extend this to every defined command, but I have a finite life.

The use of dvips is obviously assumed. Undo the archive within your own
texmf tree (for TDS-compliant distributions).

School logo history:

  Anton Frolich created the vector graphic Wits logo, as opposed to the
  bitmapped thingy I did years ago. He did this in Corel Draw. (crest.eps)

  Using LaTeX and PSTricks, I created the school logo, viewable on a full
  page by ghostscript, after a learning curve of pstricks! (school.tex.ps)

  dvips -E (and etc) created the eps form, with a bad bounding box
  (documented reasons). I manually edited the bounding box produced until the
  entire logo was visible. Thus the eps in truly vector form. (Don't forget
  that even the cm fonts are type 1 nowadays. (school.eps, copied as
  ArcSchlLogo.eps)

  Final bounding box is in school.bb

  The file ArcSchlLogoTrial.tex shows the logo from 5mm to 150mm. Nice and
  crisp.

(Since most people can't parse `sed' scripts, I'll repeat myself:)

Letterhead:
  Prints on plain paper. `ArcSchlHead.sty' is the Style File, `.tem' is the
  template file to copy for a new letter. `schllet' is a simple shell
  script to do that. An example is ArcSchlHeadEx.pdf.


Fax:
  Prints on plain paper. `ArcFax.sty' is the Style File, `.tem' is the
  template file to copy for a new fax. `schlfax' is a simple shell
  script to do that. An example is ArcFaxEx.pdf.


Memo:
  Prints on plain paper. `ArcMemo.sty' is the Style File, `.tem' is the
  template file to copy for a new memo. `schlmemo' is a simple shell
  script to do that. An example is ArcMemoEx.pdf.

  
Handout:
  Prints on plain paper. `ArcHandout.sty' is the Style File, `.tem' is the
  template file to copy for a new memo. `schlhandout' is a simple shell
  script to do that. An example is ArcHandoutEx.pdf.


Minutes:
  Prints on plain paper. `ArcMinutes.sty' is the Style File, `.tem' is the
  template file to copy for a new memo. `schlminutes' is a simple shell
  script to do that. An example is ArcMinutes.pdf.
