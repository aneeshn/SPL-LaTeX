## Master's Dissertation and PhD Thesis Class File
If you are writing up your dissertation/thesis in LaTeX, you should use the class file (`wits-eie-thesis.cls`) in the `dissertation-thesis` directory. It conforms to the faculty's style requirements (see the _Faculty Style Guide for Theses and Dissertations_ in the same directory).

The `dissertation-thesis` directory also contains an example dissertation in the `skeleton-msc-phd` sub-directory. This example has a top-level file called `main-doc` which includes the preamble, each chapter, and the appendices. It makes use of the `useful-packages` package which lists many additional packages that are helpful in formatting your dissertation/thesis. Only the essential packages have been included to reduce dependencies while the rest have been commented out. Uncomment, and use, those that you require.

If you have any suggestions for improving the class file and/or example, please email me, or make a pull-request with your changes.
